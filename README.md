# Data-analysis-val_legends

The purpose of this project was to iterate through the  players and determine their WINS, KDA, SCORE, DAMAGE, GOLDSPENT etc. 
I used the json file for league of legends and csv file for valorant as I wanted to explore both the ways.

I made this project on jupyterNotebook as most of the data analysis is done with it and it provides a better picture
of your dataset

python libraries used in this are:
1)Pandas
2)matplotlib
3)requests
